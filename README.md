# TechnomysticsWeb
Website Files for SAIC Club Court of the Technomystics.

The website itself will update every night at midnight by cloning from the main branch of this repository. The "wip" branch should be used for any changes, and a pull request to the main branch should be made when changes are finalized. 

For working and testing, please add this repository locally to your device. The easiest way to do this is to install GitHub Desktop, sign in, and click 'Add', and then 'Clone Repository'. Once you have the repository locally available, run 'index.html' with a browser to see the website. After making changes, you can do this to see what effect they've had. DO NOT CHANGE 'p5.js' OR 'p5.sound.min.js'! These are library files that provide the p5.js functionality to 'sketch.js'. If working with p5, it may be easiest to copy and paste the code into the p5.js editot at "p5js.org", to be able to see sketch changes live. Once satisfied with the changes made, you can commit to the "wip" branch of the repository as mentioned above.

I would recommend a program like 'Visual Studio Code' for interacting with HTML, CSS, and the P5.js sketch.
